============================================

1. Ensure that the splitter is connected to a power supply

2. Ensure that the airlines connecting the splitter and ventilator are attached (detailed in a serperate document)

3. Flip the on-off switch to on

4. After a short boot-up sequence, a screen showing data for each of the patient airlines should appear, which looks like this

   - If this screen doesn't appear, ensure that the Tetra Ventilator Splitter software is installed

5. Verify that all the tubing connections are good

   1. Plug in a patient tubing to port 1

   2. Connect the patient tubing to a lung model or a balloon

   3. Turn on the ventilator

   4. The numbers on column 1 of the Tubing Data Information Screen should be changing

      - If the numbers are not changing, make sure the stop valve for that port is open

   5. Turn the knobs on the control valves for that port.  The PIP and PEEP values should change with them

      - If they aren't changing, ensure all the pneumatic connections are made and tight

   6. Repeat substeps 1.-5. for ports 2, 3, and 4

6. Sterilize the patient tubing used for testing and begin treating patients
